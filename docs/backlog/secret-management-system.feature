Feature: Secret Management System

  The purpose of this work was to propose a new approach to determining the location of "secrets" in the modern software development process, which includes creating an application that will provide the ability to store secrets, define different values of secrets for different environments as needed, configure the hierarchy and dependency of secrets in one from one (also if necessary). Also, the service should provide an API for using secrets in user applications, update secrets in the application when the secrets database changes, define a set of mandatory and optional secrets for a specific application.

  Scenario: CRUD for secrets/variables

  Scenario: Unlimited permissions to CRUD secrets/variables for root user

  Scenario: Transfer secrets to application
